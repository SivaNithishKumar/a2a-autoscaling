## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🚨 For Critical Security Issues

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: **security@your-domain.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 📧 What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days

### 🏆 Security Disclosure Process

1. **Report received** - We acknowledge the report
2. **Validation** - We validate and reproduce the issue
3. **Fix development** - We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated disclosure** - We work with you on disclosure timing
5. **Public disclosure** - We publish the fix and advisory

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Container Security
- All containers run as non-root users
- Read-only root filesystems where possible
- Minimal base images (distroless/alpine)
- Regular security scanning of images
- No secrets in container images

### Kubernetes Security
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enabled
- Network policies for micro-segmentation
- Pod Security Standards enforced
- Secrets encrypted at rest
- Regular security updates

### Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure communication (TLS)
- Authentication and authorization
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting

### Infrastructure Security
- Regular security updates
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Access controls and monitoring

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Kubernetes RBAC integration
- Service account isolation
- API key management
- JWT token validation

### Network Security
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Network policies for traffic isolation
- Ingress security controls
- Service mesh integration (optional)

### Data Protection
- Secrets management with Kubernetes secrets
- Configuration encryption
- Audit logging
- Data retention policies

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Real-time alerting
- Compliance reporting

## 🔍 Security Scanning

We regularly perform:
- **Static Code Analysis** - Automated code security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning** - Third-party library vulnerability checks
- **Container Scanning** - Docker image vulnerability assessment
- **Infrastructure Scanning** - Kubernetes configuration security review

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Deployment Security
- [ ] Change default passwords
- [ ] Configure TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up proper RBAC
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Configure network policies
- [ ] Set resource limits
- [ ] Enable pod security policies

### Operational Security
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Monitor security alerts
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Backup configurations
- [ ] Test disaster recovery
- [ ] Security training for team

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Default Configurations
- Default Grafana password should be changed immediately
- AlertManager webhook URLs should be configured securely
- Kubernetes secrets should be properly managed

### Network Exposure
- Ingress controllers should be properly configured
- Load balancers should have appropriate security groups
- Internal services should not be exposed unnecessarily

### Data Handling
- Agent communications may contain sensitive data
- Logs may contain personally identifiable information
- Metrics data should be handled according to privacy policies

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Required Security Settings
```yaml
# Example security context
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
```

### Network Policies
```yaml
# Example network policy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: agent-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: a2a-agent
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: a2a-agent
```
